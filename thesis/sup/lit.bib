First by using the Stokes vector formalism, we calculate the Mueller matrix of rotational Raman scattering from a diatomic gas (such as H2, D2 and N2) for a generic scattering angle and then we use it to describe in detail the polarization characteristics of the Raman radiation available in the typical conditions of a {TS} system in a fusion plasma. Then we consider the various experimental set-ups proposed for polarimetric {TS} and show that rotational Raman scattering can generate radiation with known intensity and polarization states that, although not equal to those of the {TS} radiation, are suitable for the calibration of polarimetric {TS} diagnostics. Finally we point out that in fusion experiments Raman polarimetry may be of interest also for the calibration of other polarization-based measurement systems, such as the motional Stark effect ({MSE}) diagnostics.},

Established supervised learning algorithms inject randomness into the construction of the individual base learners in an effort to promote diversity within the resulting ensembles. An undesirable side effect of this approach is that it generally also reduces the accuracy of the base learners. In this paper, we introduce a method that is simple to implement yet general and effective in improving ensemble diversity with only modest impact on the accuracy of the individual base learners. By randomly rotating the feature space prior to inducing the base learners, we achieve favorable aggregate predictions on standard data sets compared to state of the art ensemble methods, most notably for tree-based ensembles, which are particularly sensitive to rotation.},

	title = {Characterization of Higher Order Modes in Optical Fibers},
	url = {https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/frontdoor/index/index/docId/901},
	abstract = {Higher-order-mode fibers generate today a great interest and find various applications in new photonic devices. The knowledge of the intermodal dispersion characteristics of higher-order-mode fibers is of interest for dispersion compensation, fiber refractive-index profile characterization, and a variety of in-fiber devices. In this context it is necessary to identify the individual transverse modes and to precisely characterize the dispersion properties of these modes. On the other hand, light beams, possessing special polarization structure, have recently attracted a great deal of interest. Several fiber techniques have been developed to generate such beams while employing higher-order modes of respective shapes. For example, radially or azimuthally polarized doughnut beams have found applications in various fields. They have a field similar to {TM}01 or {TE}01 vector mode in the {LP}11 mode group of a circular fiber. Therefore, these doughnut beams can be considered to be generated by an optical fiber. It is shown in the present work that in practice a {TM}01 or {TE}01 mode can not propagate in step-index fibers which support {LP}01 and {LP}11 modes. The reason for this is the anisotropy of the fiber and the degeneracy of the modes in the {LP}11 mode group. However, these doughnut beams can be generated at the end facet of the fiber by selective excitation of {LP}11 modes in the fiber under adequate pressure and twist. Unfortunately, since this mode selection process involves several fiber modes propagating at different phase velocities, the transverse intensity distribution will vary strongly along the fiber. However, in many applications, a stable transverse beam pattern is required. In order to excite a single higher-order mode in optical fibers, a full characterization of the intermodal dispersion and mode profiles as well as the polarization state of these modes is essential. This thesis focuses on a novel time-domain low-coherence interferometry technique for characterizing the intermodal dispersion and mode profiles of any type of higher-order-mode optical fibers. The measurement can be done without any prior knowledge of the fiber properties. The interferometry uses an erbium-doped fiber amplifier ({EDFA}) as a low-coherence broadband light source. In the fiber arm the light is coupled into the tested few-mode fiber. In the reference arm, a mirror is controlled to obtain the same optical path as each of fiber modes. A phase-shifting algorithm is used to interpret the interference fringes obtained on a camera at the interferometer’s output. The mode intensity profile and the amplitude of the mode are obtained in real time. Depending on the features of the tested fiber, an interferometer of Michelson or Mach-Zehnder type is used. One of the fibers under test is a few-mode all-glass fiber with special refractive-index profile. The Michelson low-coherence interferometer is used to characterize the intermodal dispersion and the mode profiles of the fiber. The measured intermodal dispersion of the {LP}01, {LP}11, {LP}21 and {LP}02 modes agrees very well with the results of our numerical simulations. It is shown that the four modes in the {LP}11 mode group of the tested fiber have a larger group-index difference than those of step-index fibers. This is indeed the advantage of the fiber design. The group-index difference of the degenerate {HE}21 modes in the {LP}11 mode group is used to determine the ellipticity of the fiber core. The estimated ellipticity is experimentally confirmed by the measurement of the group-index difference of the fundamental {LP}01 modes using a frequency-domain low-coherence interferometry technique. Additionally, the Mach-Zehnder low-coherence interferometer is used to characterize the chromatic dispersion of the fundamental modes and the intermodal dispersion of a few-mode solid-core photonic crystal fiber. The group-index difference between the {LP}01 and {LP}11 modes agrees very well with the results of the numerical simulations. The absolute chromatic dispersion of the {LP}01 mode is estimated without sweeping the wavelength. The measurement resolution is discussed.},

	abstract = {Multimode optical fibers have seen increasing applications in communication, imaging, high-power lasers and amplifiers. However, inherent imperfections and environmental perturbations cause random polarization and mode mixing, making the output polarization states very different from the input one. This poses a serious issue for employing polarization sensitive techniques to control light-matter interactions or nonlinear optical processes at the distal end of a fiber probe. Here we demonstrate a complete control of polarization states for all output channels by only manipulating the spatial wavefront of a laser beam into the fiber. Arbitrary polarization states for individual output channels are generated by wavefront shaping without constraint on input polarizations. The strong coupling between spatial and polarization degrees of freedom in a multimode fiber enables full polarization control with spatial degrees of freedom alone, transforming a multimode fiber to a highly-efficient reconfigurable matrix of waveplates.},

Die vorliegende Arbeit stellt sich zur Aufgabe, diese Methode für die Untersuchung biologischer Proben so zu optimieren, dass der Einfluss der notwendigen hohen Beleuchtungsenergie auf die Probe möglichst gering bleibt und trotzdem zeitnahe Ergebnisse erzielt werden können. Dazu wird ein Raman-Mikrospektrometer basierend auf einem neuen bildgebenden Fourier-Transformations-Spektrometer und einer Lichtschichtbeleuchtung entwickelt und einem dem Stand der Technik entsprechenden konfokalen Raman-Mikrospektrometer gegenübergestellt. Das entwickelte Raman-Mikrospektrometer kann ein hyperspektrales Raman-Bild von einer Polymerprobe, mit über 4 000 000 Spektren und einer spektralen Auflösung von 4,4 cm 1 in unter 14 min aufzeichnen. Das zum Vergleich herangezogene Mikrospektrometer benötigt für die gleiche Aufgabe 213 mal länger. Außerdem wird mit beiden Spektrometern ein Volumen einer Zebrafischprobe aus 50 Ebenen mit voller spektraler Information aufgezeichnet. Bei gleicher Abbildungsqualität ist das entwickelte Raman-Mikrospektrometer noch immer 5,3 mal schneller. Basierend auf diesen praktischen Erkenntnissen werden die Signalentstehung in Mikrospektrometern verschiedenen Typs und der Einfluss der Beleuchtung auf die Probe theoretisch untersucht. Im Ergebnis können die erzielbaren Geschwindigkeiten aller Mikrospektrometertypen bei gleicher Bildqualität auf einfache Weise verglichen werden. Es zeigt sich, dass die gleichzeitige Beleuchtung von mehreren Probenpunkten aus thermischen Gründen eine Drosselung der Bestrahlungsstärke erzwingt. Dadurch werden die Geschwindigkeitsvorteile der Parallelisierung nivelliert. Das bestätigt nicht nur die Erfahrungen mit dem hier entwickelten Lichtschicht-Raman-Mikrospektrometer sondern weist auch die Richtung für künftige Versuche zur weiteren, deutlichen Geschwindigkeitssteigerung auf.},

This chapter focuses on the main features of the different parts of a modern Raman microspectrometer, including the basis of data acquisition and processing. To obtain the best possible spectral and spatial data, each component has to be designed or selected to fit into an integrated unit which insures maximum reliability and stability of optical alignment and mechanical adjustment. Some of the dominant factors which must be considered are (1) quality, filtering and focusing of the laser excitation beam, (2) wide solid angle of collection with minimum aberration, (3) optimized optical coupling of the observed microvolume of sample to the photodetector via the spectral analyzer, and (4) sophisticated data accumulation and processing of the spectral and spatial information. The chapter also summarizes some characteristics of a Gaussian laser beam and reviews the microscope objectives. The microscope objective is the core of the Raman microspectrometer, as it plays the most important role of coupling both the light source and the spectral analyzer to the specimen. All of the potential information, spectral as well as spatial, is contained in the objective and in the primary enlarged image of the sample.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, Raman spectroscopy has gained more and more interest in research as well as in clinical laboratories. As a vibrational spectroscopy technique, it is complementary to the also well-established infrared spectroscopy. Through specific spectral patterns, substances can be identified and molecular changes can be observed with high specificity. Because of a high spatial resolution due to an excitation wavelength in the visible and near-infrared range, Raman spectroscopy combined with microscopy is very powerful for imaging biological samples. Individual cells can be imaged on the subcellular level. In vivo tissue examinations are becoming increasingly important for clinical applications. In this review, we present currently ongoing research in different fields of medical diagnostics involving linear Raman spectroscopy and imaging. We give a wide overview over applications for the detection of atherosclerosis, cancer, inflammatory diseases and pharmacology, with a focus on developments over the past 5 years. Conclusions drawn from Raman spectroscopy are often validated by standard methods, for example, histopathology or {PCR}. The future potential of Raman spectroscopy and its limitations are discussed in consideration of other non-linear Raman techniques.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is an emerging technique in bioanalysis and imaging of biomaterials owing to its unique capability of generating spectroscopic fingerprints. Imaging cells and tissues by Raman microspectroscopy represents a nondestructive and label-free approach. All components of cells or tissues contribute to the Raman signals, giving rise to complex spectral signatures. Resonance Raman scattering and surface-enhanced Raman scattering can be used to enhance the signals and reduce the spectral complexity. Raman-active labels can be introduced to increase specificity and multimodality. In addition, nonlinear coherent Raman scattering methods offer higher sensitivities, which enable the rapid imaging of larger sampling areas. Finally, fiber-based imaging techniques pave the way towards in vivo applications of Raman spectroscopy. This Review summarizes the basic principles behind medical Raman imaging and its progress since 2012.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy has gained increasing attention in biomedical diagnostics thanks to instrumental developments and chemometric models that enhance the accuracy and speed of this technique. In particular, a model transfer procedure is needed if the chemometric models are utilized to predict a new dataset measured under (secondary) conditions different to the training data (primary). The model transfer methods try to achieve satisfactory prediction on the secondary dataset with minimal or no training samples measured under secondary conditions. Model transfer methods that have been reported are mostly applied for near-infrared spectroscopy and in regression problems. The investigation of model transfer in Raman spectroscopy and classification is rare. Our recently reported Tikhonov regularization based on partial least squares regression ({TR}-{PLSR}) was utilized for model transfer of Raman-based classification models for spore species. In the present work, we show that the {TR}-{PLSR} also works for Raman spectra of vegetative bacteria, even though the Raman spectra of 3 species of bacteria were acquired on 3 different Raman spectrometers. Additionally, we report 2 newly developed model transfer methods for Raman spectra: movement of principal components scores and spectral augmentation. Both methods were validated based on the Raman spectra of bacterial spores and vegetative bacteria, where a significant improvement of the model transferability was observed. The movement of principal components scores method yielded results comparable with those of the {TR}-{PLSR}. However, the new methods are superior to {TR}-{PLSR} in 2 ways: No training samples in the secondary conditions are necessary, and the methods are not restricted to partial least squares regression but can also be applied to other models. Both advantages are important in real-world applications and represent a large step for improving the model transfer of Raman spectra.},
