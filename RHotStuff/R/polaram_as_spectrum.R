#' Compute A Raman Spectrum From PolaRam Output
#'       
#' This function takes the output of the polaram simulate program and computes one possible raman spectrum. PolaRam is a program that simulates the
#' raman scattering process with respect to the polarisation of the light. For details see the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/AlreadyTakenJonas/PolaRam).
#' The spectrum will be computed as sum of loretz curves. Every peak of the spectrum will be modeled by a lorentz curve. This function makes the assuption, that
#' the spectrum was created with a hypothetical photo detector, that responds differently to light polarised along the x-axis and y-axis. The two scalars scaleX
#' and scaleY allow to influence the height of the signal, depending of the polarisation of the hypothetically detectable light. If both values are one, the light
#' will be not distinguished by its polarisation.
#' 
#' @param x A vector of wavnumbers. The function computes for every wavenumber one point of the spectrum.
#' @param stokes.S0 The first stokes parameter of the scattered light. It may be a vector with one element for each peak.
#' @param stokes.S1 The second stokes parameter of the scattered light. It may be a vector with one element for each peak.
#' @param peaks.wavenumber The wavenumber of the raman peak. It may be a vector with one element for each peak.
#' @param gamma A scalar describing the width of the peaks. It may be a vector with one element for each peak. If the vector gamma is shorter than the peaks.wavenumber
#' vector, gamma will be reapeated until the length of both vectors match. The FWHM is in terms of the peaks width gamma (g) and the peaks wavenumber (v):
#' FWHM = sqrt(v^2 + vg) - sqrt(v^2 - vg) .
#' @param normalise Boolean value. If true the spectrum will be divided by its maximum.
#' @param scaleX Multiplicator, which describes how sensitive the photo detector is along the x-axis.
#' @param scaleY Multiplicator, which describes how sensitive the photo detector is along the y-axis.
#' @return A data frame containing a calculated raman spectrum.
